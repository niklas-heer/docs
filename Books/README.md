### Scrum: The art of doing twice the work in half the time

>We live in a world that is broken. For those who believe that there must be a more efficient way for people to get things done, here from Scrum pioneer Jeff Sutherland is a brilliantly discursive, thought-provoking book about the management process that is changing the way we live.

A really good book with many stories, about the origin of Scrum, how it came to be and how it was used.

### Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less

>The Way of the Essentialist isn’t about getting more done in less time. It’s about getting only the right things done.  It is not  a time management strategy, or a productivity technique. It is a systematic discipline for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.
>
> By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.

I really found this book helpful. The concept of "less, but better" was eye opening. Everybody should read this book.

### Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration

> “What does it mean to manage well?”
> From Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios, comes an incisive book about creativity in business. Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture — but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and WALL-E, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.

This is a really great book, because it uses the stories it tells to give you valuable insights in how people work together. Highly recommend this book!

### Elon Musk: Inventing the Future

> In the spirit of Steve Jobs and Moneyball, Elon Musk is both an illuminating and authorized look at the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most exciting, unpredictable, and ambitious entrepreneurs, Elon Musk—a real-life Tony Stark—and a fascinating exploration of the renewal of American invention and its new “makers”
>
> Elon Musk spotlights the technology and vision of Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, who sold one of his internet companies, PayPal, for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius’s life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits.

It is both fascinating and inspiring to get an insight into how Elon Musks is thinking and how he tackles problems. I highly recommend this book to everybody.

### Die Kunst des klugen Handelns, 52 Irrwege, die Sie besser anderen überlassen

> Unser Gehirn ist eine Wundermaschine – komplexer und leistungsfähiger als jeder Computer. Doch in unserer Bewunderung für die Krone der Evolution vergessen wir oft eines: Das Gehirn ist auch ziemlich fehleranfällig. Wie sonst ist es logisch zu erklären, dass man beim Fußball automatisch für die Mannschaft aus dem eigenen Land mitfiebert? Oder dass man Menschen, die anderer Meinung sind, gern mal für Idioten hält? Wer die Irrwege des Denkens kennt, kann sie für sich nutzen und öfter die richtigen Entscheidungen treffen, sei es im Marketing, in der Karriere oder im privaten Alltag. Die Vielzahl konkreter Beispiele zeigt immer wieder neue Aspekte auf.

Dieses Buch schafft es eigene Irrwege aufzudecken und umzudenken. Ich empfehle dieses Buch jedem!
